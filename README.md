At work, I was given a code that was always re-used for multi test purposes. 

The code given to me was called main.tf and I had to create a module to be able to provision the same ressources.

I had to break it down to 8 different files in order to make sure that any given new hired DevOps engineer can come to our work environment, with or without a strong knowledge of Terraform, will be able to apply some changes as needed to his project. I made it easy for my DevOps team to be just a plug and play.

Keep in mind that I created 8 files for this modules, but to change it as needed for a new project, please modify only the file named: " Gaetan.tfvars " . 
PS: Leave the rest of 7 files unchanged and you will be good to go.

I have added some outputs snapshots to this github repo so that you know that this module works smoothly.

Feel free to add any modification or contribution. 
I am always excited to work with DevOps engineers.

I hope you enjoy this project!!!!

Have a nice rest of your day!!!
Happy coding day!!!
